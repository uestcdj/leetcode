//682é¢˜You're now a baseball game point recorder.
//
//Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:
//
//Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
//"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
//"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
//"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
//Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.
//
//You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.
